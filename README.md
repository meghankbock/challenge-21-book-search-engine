# challenge-21-book-search-engine

## Summary
This repository contains the front- and back-end code for the Book Search Engine Application. This application is a React-based web application that utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and GraphQL. Users of this application can sign-up/create a profile if they are new, log in if they have an existing profile, search for books using the Google Books API, and save these books to their profile. In addition to saving book selections to MongoDB, the application also saves these to local storage. The live version of this application is deployed to Heroku.
