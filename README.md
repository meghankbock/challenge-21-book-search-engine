# challenge-21-book-search-engine

## Summary
This repository contains the front- and back-end code for the Book Search Engine Application. This application is a React-based web application that utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and GraphQL to allow users to sign-up and create a profile, search books using the Google Books API, and save these books to their profile. In addition to saving book selections to MongoDB, the application also saves these to local storage.
